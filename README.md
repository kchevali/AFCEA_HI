## In Short
Project management experience with team (6 persons) to build website / mobile app (iOS) for client.

## Description
This project was a collaborative team capstone project for my undergraduate CS degree. The objective of the project was to provide a new modern web framework for the AFCEA Hawaii Section and to streamline the content of their two websites to a central site. My main contribution was a leadership role within the developing team and my independent side project to develop a mobile application in SwiftUI that displays the organization's news feeds from the central database. The important skills that I took from this project was applying the techniques for project management, user communication and proper documentation.
